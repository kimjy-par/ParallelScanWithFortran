# ParallelScan
Parallel scan is a useful algorithm for many area such as scientific computing, data mining and athers. Scientific computing like numerical weather prediction requires parallel processing due to huge computation for high resolution simulation and more accurate prediction. Moreover, they use Fortran language, because Fortran language has convinience of numerical computation.
Thus, I have written naive parallel scan algorithm with fortran language and parallelized on GPU using OpenACC directives.

If you have bug or problem of question about my code, please let me know through email.
